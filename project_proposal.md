# Project Proposal

Use this template to help get you started right away! Once the proposal is complete, please let your mentor know that this is ready to be reviewed.

## Get Started

### Tech Stack - What tech stack will you use for your final project? It is recommended to use the following technologies in this project: Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Heroku, Jinja, RESTful APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. Depending on your idea, you might end up using WTForms and other technologies discussed in the course.
#### Answer: In my project I am thinking to use Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Jinja, RESTful API, JavaScript, HTML, CSS         

### Type - Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?
#### Answer: It is going to be a web application

### Goal - What goal will your project be designed to achieve?
#### Answer: the main point of the project is to make an entertaining app where user can take part of the trivia game based on the theme of geography, and educational encyclopedia where you can find an interesting facts about countries

### Users - What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?                                       
#### Answer: I am aiming to tackle the general pool, and people who are actually interested in geography and would like to learn about countries

### Data - What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack, you are required to create your own API.
#### Answer: I am still searching for the API yet, Iâ€™ve found one good candidate (https://api-ninjas.com/api/country); I would use an API which returns a list of countries with details by passing in parameters, like population, capital, land area, etc. However, for my trivia game I might create my own API since I am still working on the aspect of how exactly the trivia game should look like

# Current Tasks:

- Determining database schema
- Outline RESTful API routes
- Implement user authentication/authorization functionality
- Connect frontend and backend 
- Determining the functionality of the trivia game (setting up the scoring points, when the game will start and when should it end)
- Create the chart with the scoring points of all users
- Organizing user profile view
